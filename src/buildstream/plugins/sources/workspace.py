workspace - stage an opened workspace directory
===============================================

**Usage:**

The workspace plugin must not be directly used. This plugin is used as the
kind for a synthetic node representing the sources of an element with an open
workspace. The node constructed would be specified as follows:

.. code:: yaml

   # Specify the workspace source kind
   kind: workspace

   # Specify the absolute path to the directory
   path: /path/to/workspace
"""
